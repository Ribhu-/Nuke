# ☲☢☠ Nuke ☠☢☲
Now nuke & incinerate multiple websites with this bulk URL DoS Tool!  
Accepts multiple ',' separated URLs and performs an HTTP/HTTPS GET attack by opening Infinite Browser Tabs, backed up by Crash Protection, where opened windows are auto-closed for RAM relief.  

Just run it in your **TOR** browser.  
Bookmark it for ease of access.  
Pass your desired comma separated URLs, or just a single URL.  
Click the '**"Incinerate!!!"**' button.  
Watch the websites / website die out slowly.  
You might wish to go and get a chalice of rum / vodka / whisky / scotch / wine etc. by this time.  

**_FYI : Before running the Nuke tool, remember to Whitelist it in the Browser Settings. 
Menu (top right) -> Options -> Privacy & Security (left side menu) -> Block pop-up windows (scroll down) -> Exceptions -> add the url of the file._**  

**_Also, after every 1000th attack it will auto-close previous 1000 tabs to preserve memory. You can vary the frequency of auto-close operation on need basis (var autoCloseFrequency)._**  

**_Also, remember, more URLs = less tabs allocated to each URL within the autoCloseFrequency limit.  
So, if URLs > 5, increase autoCloseFrequency, & pray that your RAM has got enough juice._**

Please use it for research purpose only.

(1) May result in taking down the TOR Network.  
(2) RAM Intensive.
