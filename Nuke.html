****************************************************************************************************
☲☢☠ Nuke ☠☢☲
****************************************************************************************************

Now nuke & incinerate multiple websites with this bulk URL DoS Tool!
Accepts multiple ',' separated URLs and performs an HTTP/HTTPS GET attack by opening Infinite Browser Tabs, backed up by Crash Protection, where opened windows are auto-closed for RAM relief.

Just run it in your TOR browser.
Bookmark it for ease of access.
Pass your desired comma separated URLs, or just a single URL.
Click the '"Incinerate!!!"' button.
Watch the websites / website die out slowly.
You might wish to go and get a chalice of rum / vodka / whisky / scotch / wine etc. by this time.

FYI : Before running the Nuke tool, remember to Whitelist it in the Browser Settings. Menu (top right) -> Options -> Privacy & Security (left side menu) -> Block pop-up windows (scroll down) -> Exceptions -> add the url of the file.

Also, after every 1000th attack it will auto-close previous 1000 tabs to preserve memory. You can vary the frequency of auto-close operation on need basis (var autoCloseFrequency).

Also, remember, more URLs = less tabs allocated to each URL within the autoCloseFrequency limit.
So, if URLs > 5, increase autoCloseFrequency, & pray that your RAM has got enough juice.

NOTE:
I wrote these tools for researching ways to Stress Test an onion site (a Darknet / Deepweb / Darkweb site).
Please use it for research purpose only.

Cons:
(1) May result in taking down the TOR Network.
(2) RAM Intensive.
